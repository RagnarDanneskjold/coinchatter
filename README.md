#coin_chatter

A BitCoin ticker with an eye on metadata.  OP_RETURN is a new part of the bitcoin spec.  Basically anyone can add 40 bits of information to the end of a bitcoin transaction and it will be kept in the blockchain forever.  This is the source code for a website that tries to monitor what people are using OP_RETURN for.

The current iteration of this site has two ways to lo look at OP_RETURN transactions.  One, we have an archive, which is just a fixed file of OP_RETURN containing transactions, generated by the python scraper. The other option we have is a ticker of every bitcoin transaction that is happening with the option to filter for OP_RETURN.
